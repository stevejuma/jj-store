# CLI and server commands

First custom commands: init, attach, status, capabilities, doctor, serve-local,
and credential login/logout. JSON is never paged. Custom standalone no-command
invocation prints help successfully; ordinary upstream jj defaults stay intact.
Match jj-nostr presentation semantics without inheriting its storage or daemon
installation policy. Secrets stay out of argv, output, and checked-in config.

## M0 extension qualification

The Apache-2.0 upstream example compiles at the pinned release and is exercised
through isolated init/describe/log/op-log/evolog commands. Its Git backend is
reference-only; native commands and presentation coverage remain M3.

The native library lifecycle fixture covers the stores used by the future custom
CLI, including independent local caches, repository attachment, transactions and
reopening. It is not executable command-presentation or remote CLI evidence.

The CLI integration library binds remote RPC authority and immutable object I/O
to the existing native factories. Loopback network lifecycle tests qualify this
binding separately from the future executable command presentation matrix.

## Executable native workspace client

The development `target/debug/jj` registers lazy remote factories with upstream
CliRunner. Ordinary JJ command parsing, transactions and workspace updates
remain upstream-owned. Each CLI invocation owns its factory cache and Tokio
runtime; there is no global mutable repository or principal. Native workspace
bindings contain the endpoint, repository, profile and transport limits, never
credentials.

`store attach` creates a separate physical workspace and local metadata
directory. Its destination must be empty and its logical workspace name must be
unique. `store status` and `store doctor` inspect remote heads without
snapshotting local files or reconciling operations. `store capabilities`
distinguishes verified native commands from unsupported or still-unqualified
ones. The ledger records command-family completion and the remaining
presentation matrix.

`store login` validates a token before storing it in the platform credential
facility; stdin or a hidden terminal prompt supplies the secret. `store logout`
deletes only the selected endpoint/repository credential. `JJ_STORE_TOKEN`
overrides stored credentials for automation and is never persisted. Custom text
results and authored help follow jj-nostr paging, Markdown and color
conventions; JSON results are plain, newline-terminated and never paged.

A hosted-RPC acceptance fixture creates a repository through the operator API,
then attaches and describes history with the actual custom jj executable. It
reopens the host with no in-memory repository directory. This qualifies dynamic
routing; standalone process and initialization have separate cold executable
acceptance below.

## Standalone process

`jj-store run --config PATH` serves in the foreground and reports its bound
listener only after validating configuration, TLS and the operator policy.
`jj store serve-local --server-config PATH` uses the same composition and
requires a literal loopback bind address. Both stop on interrupt/termination and
bound graceful shutdown. Neither installs a daemon nor launches RustFS.

`jj-store config example` prints the configuration template, while
`config check` validates it without contacting storage.
`doctor --config PATH --repo-id ID` checks the configured repository through the
in-process authenticated service. It does not publish operations.
`operator init` persists a verifier for an environment-injected or OS-held
operator credential; `operator list/revoke` administer that trusted local policy
file. Token values are never command-line arguments or output. Repository token
commands remain a separate command slice.

On Unix, serve-local is parsed by CliRunner and then replaces the process with
the paired jj-store binary from the same executable directory. This resets the
upstream CLI's immediate-exit signal handler so the server owns graceful
shutdown. Other platforms fail explicitly and direct users to jj-store run;
platform handoff qualification remains a release gate.

Attachment records a bounded, secret-free local journal outside the checkout.
Before publishing it durably retains the exact operation and parent IDs; retries
use that identity through the native receipt path. Connection, credential ID,
workspace and path changes on retry fail explicitly. Cache initialization stages
complete bindings before rename. Physical metadata appears only after
publication is acknowledged; resuming never snapshots or overwrites source
files.

`store init` provisions a new repository using a separate operator credential,
durably retaining generated repository/epoch IDs before contacting the server.
The initial admin credential is saved to the OS facility or provided explicitly
through the automation environment. It reuses recoverable attachment; repeating
an acknowledged initialization cannot create another repository or workspace.
Current admin access with the exact retained epoch can resolve a lost creation
acknowledgement after operator revocation.

Both executables expose the same typed repository
`token list/grant/revoke/ status/retry` implementation over authenticated native
RPC. Grant credentials enter through hidden input, bounded stdin or a dedicated
environment variable. Before applying, the CLI writes an exclusive, bounded,
secret-free request file outside checkouts with its snapshot, principal, request
ID and intent. Retries never refresh the snapshot. Status queries publish
nothing; absent receipts remain unknown. Current admin access and the original
principal are required; credential rotation for that principal does not change
request identity.

Executable semantic parity compares native RPC repositories with the pinned
upstream Git backend at equivalent histories. Comparisons retain descriptions,
parent counts, local bookmark names, conflict state, file content and evolution
while excluding backend-specific IDs and timestamps. Rewrites,
split/squash/abandon, three-way conflicts, divergent changes and operation
reconciliation require explicit acceptance before the capability matrix
advertises them as verified.

The verified capability matrix includes rebase, squash, split, abandon, undo,
manual conflict snapshotting, divergent operations and conflicted local
bookmarks. Separate Unix fixtures qualify binary/symlink/executable checkout
state and SSH sign/re-sign/unsign behavior. Native Git transport and destructive
GC commands fail without publication. Other external merge tools, signers and
release platforms remain separately qualified; file-copy snapshot evidence does
not replace native copy-history codec/query evidence.

Standalone TLS acceptance uses generated certificates, explicit client trust and
hostname verification, with the development plaintext override disabled. Cold
real-storage CLI recovery runs through this same TLS listener; memory-backed RPC
acceptance and plaintext loopback startup remain separate evidence lanes.

Native library acceptance also exercises application read selection against real
JJ transactions. This verifies that inspecting concurrent operations cannot
invoke the CLI's mutation/reconciliation behavior. The read surface remains a
service capability until its separate HTTP and graph integration slices.

Graph acceptance compares library results with native transaction histories,
including filtered edges, hidden predecessors, sibling operations and cache
rebuilds. Upstream types and transaction fixtures stay in the CLI/JJ boundary;
application services consume only owned graph requests and responses.

Native transaction fixtures also qualify service continuation cursors across
publication, checkpointing, revocation and expiry. These are library acceptance
tests; HTTP and browser pagination require their own later transport coverage.

Native content fixtures qualify all object variants, merged directory entries,
binary file ranges, revocation during streaming and unchanged manifest state.
These library fixtures complement CLI parity; media headers and safe rendering
still require HTTP/browser acceptance.

Directory cursor fixtures verify exact committed snapshots through later writes,
checkpointing and retries, alongside graph cursor cross-query rejection and
shared capacity. HTTP/browser integration remains separate acceptance.
