# Architecture

Crates are added as milestones begin, not as empty placeholders. Native codecs
initially live with JJ integration. The server uses in-process stores rather
than calling its own RPC. Local indexes are derived and rebuildable. The source
repo is colocated for development; product storage has no Git carrier.

## Requirements

| ID           | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JST-ARCH-001 | The repository MUST provide a Rust workspace with independently owned native storage, publication, JJ integration, services, transports, adapters, and presentation boundaries. |
| JST-ARCH-002 | Model, object storage, and WAL MUST NOT depend on UI, Tantivy, Git transport, SQL, Nostr, or agent runtimes; upstream JJ integration MUST stay behind owned adapters.           |
| JST-ARCH-003 | First release MUST serve new native repositories locally and on an authenticated shared server using the same storage format, with no required Git, SQL, or relay authority.    |

Storage harness self-tests are part of normal validation. `pnpm test:rustfs`
executes only isolated disposable Docker probes and writes a scratch report. An
approved immutable report is retained with its exact image/topology.

## M0 extension qualification

M0 introduces only CLI and JJ compatibility crates. The upstream example is a
Git-backed test executable; it does not advertise a production backend. Both JJ
crates now resolve together through the committed Cargo lockfile.

## Object foundation

The model crate owns typed IDs, object kinds and envelope framing without
importing JJ. The JJ integration crate owns native schemas and identity checks.
Version 1 metadata is bounded independently of the streaming file transport.
