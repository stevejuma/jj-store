# Security and deployment

Token revocation is checked independently of index freshness. RustFS credentials
remain server-side. Local operator tooling provisions the first repository and
scoped credentials. Logs and receipts record authenticated actors, never secret
bytes or caller-supplied authorship as authentication. Search degradation does
not make authoritative storage unready.
