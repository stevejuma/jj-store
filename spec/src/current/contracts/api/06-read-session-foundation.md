# Read-session foundation

Application read sessions capture the checked manifest's repository, epoch,
publication position, revision and native head set. An omitted operation selects
only a sole head; concurrent heads return an explicit selection response without
reconciliation. An explicit historical operation must belong to the captured
committed inventory. Staged candidates and objects published after selection
cannot enter that session's membership set.

The owned read capability has no publication methods and cannot be reconstructed
from its informational DTO. Interactive sessions retain the immutable inventory
catalog root, not a complete repository inventory. Requested object membership
uses verified catalog point lookups. Distinct requested objects and elapsed time
are capped by trusted server limits; complete inventory enumeration has its own
explicit bound. Each later access rechecks current permission and epoch while
retaining the original snapshot. Epoch changes require reselection; later
publications in the same epoch do not silently replace the selected view. The
graph layer owns index/query budgets and workspace-dependent revsets; the
pagination layer binds continuations. HTTP and browser integration consume these
owned service interfaces.

Elapsed-time guards check before and after polling an operation as well as
applying asynchronous timeouts. An immediately ready in-memory or cached result
cannot bypass an expired request deadline.

The native graph interface has explicit log context (logical workspace, author
email for identity-relative expressions, and a fixed time anchor). It uses no
user configuration, physical checkout, shell command or CLI output parser.
Continuation is a native graph-node identity in the same query traversal;
missing continuation nodes fail explicitly. Signing and binding these internal
continuations to transport requests is owned by the service pagination layer.
