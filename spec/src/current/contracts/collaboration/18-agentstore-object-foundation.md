# AgentStore object foundation

The native-capture binding's public shape validator is shared by optional host
adapters. It validates bounded opaque identities only; repository admission and
execution authority remain host-owned. Existing envelope, observation and
canonical AgentStore object bytes are unchanged.

`jj-agent` owns distinct fixed-width stable IDs for sessions, attempts, turns,
messages, blocks, tool calls, terminals, checkpoints, associations,
observations, events, devices and capture sources. Content-addressed
`AgentObjectId` values remain separate from those durable entity IDs. Native JJ
operation, commit and change IDs retain their existing owned types and are not
reinterpreted as agent identities.

`AgentRootV1` selects independent persistent radix catalogs for sessions,
aliases, checkpoints, associations, relations, sources and projections. Empty
catalogs are represented by absent page roots in one canonical empty root.
Catalog pages are bounded immutable objects with canonical digest keys and typed
strong references. Every staged root and page validates its complete
repository-bound dependency closure before it can be selected; missing objects,
semantic kind mismatches, unknown fields and noncanonical bytes fail closed.
Only the publication coordinator can turn staged objects into visible state.

Sanitized observation batches and normalized event batches are distinct
immutable objects. Observation batches record integration, source instance,
source order, source kind/trust, representation and sanitizer version; their
payload is validated canonical JSON or UTF-8 text rather than an arbitrary
untyped JSON value. Event batches reference their exact evidence batch and use
stable event/entity IDs. Normalization therefore cannot replace or rename the
accepted source evidence.

Session snapshots select exact evidence, event, transcript and tool object
versions. Tool snapshots keep execution state separate from capture evidence and
reference typed sanitized input/output content. Transcript manifests keep each
source generation separate and root an ordered immutable chunk-page closure
sufficient for direct reconstruction; they have no indispensable
previous-manifest link. Checkpoint discovery remains in its root-level catalog,
so a session snapshot has no mutable or circular checkpoint reference.

Checkpoint versions pin exact session, transcript, event, tool and association
objects plus complete before/after native operation and commit anchor sets. They
distinguish changed, verified no-change and not-observed code relations; a
failed tool can still have changed code. Completeness, capture status and
execution outcome remain independent. Superseded checkpoints are immutable
strong edges and cannot point back from a session snapshot.

Code associations are many-to-many assertions with stable association, session,
optional checkpoint/turn/tool/scope identities, full native IDs, optional JJ
change IDs, repository-relative paths, evidence method, trust, coverage and
exclusivity. Correction versions must name a prior immutable association and a
reason. File claims reject absolute or traversing paths, and manual assertions
cannot masquerade as stronger evidence. Stable IDs and JJ change IDs are lookup
facts; exact operation/commit IDs and immutable evidence objects are retention
edges.

Portable `CodeAssociationV2` and `AgentCheckpointVersionV2` use explicit source
repository, profile and capsule references for operations and commits. A commit
must match its evidence profile. Their shared non-code facts preserve the native
path, evidence, correction, coverage and dependency rules. Canonical bounded
decoders reject unknown versions, fields and noncanonical bytes. Native V1 field
order and serialization remain frozen; these additive models do not by
themselves enable a persistence provider or CLI command.

Portable object variants retain the existing repository-bound AgentObject record
framing and semantic catalog kinds. Shared provenance projection validates the
selected session and pinned checkpoint dependencies, exact correction selection
and stable identities, then adds typed session/tool/checkpoint/code relation
pages. Git relation subjects carry source-profile evidence rather than native
commit IDs. Native storage rejects portable evidence until its own capsule
carrier is implemented; it cannot silently discard those retention edges.

An AgentStore read is pinned to one selected `AgentRootV1`. Stable session,
checkpoint and association keys resolve through bounded persistent radix pages;
immutable object reads succeed only for references in that root's audited
transitive closure. A staged but unselected object is not readable through the
pinned facade. Catalog leaves contain at most 32 selections, branch updates copy
only the affected path, and prior roots remain readable.

Typed agent deltas carry expected and replacement selections for all seven
catalogs. They reject duplicate edits, semantic kind substitution and no-op
edits. A disjoint edit can reapply to a newer agent root after a CAS race, while
a changed expected selection is stale. The stable request intent covers the
original delta rather than generated page/root IDs, so receipt replay remains
valid after later agent publications.

Alias objects bind an integration, source instance, native entity kind and
native ID to a matching stable session, turn, message, tool, checkpoint or
association identity. These lookup facts are not strong object references.
Relation subjects are typed session, tool, operation, revision or checkpoint
identities. Their catalog selections are immutable linked pages containing only
checkpoint and association object references; each page repeats its subject so a
cursor from another relation fails closed.

Source-state objects retain the integration/source identity, generation,
versioned parser, optional native session key, source-specific accepted
position, strictly ordered non-overlapping capture-batch receipts and coverage.
Projection catalogs retain one normalizer version and activation time plus exact
selected session, normalized-event and source-state object versions. Replaying a
parser therefore publishes new selected objects rather than mutating prior
facts.

Catalog enumeration is radix ordered and root pinned, returns at most 256
selections and resumes after a stable catalog key. Relation traversal uses a
root-local page/offset cursor and rejects mismatched subjects. Transcript reads
select one source generation from an immutable manifest, verify strictly
increasing chunk sequences across linked pages and enforce both a record count
and an eight MiB caller-selected byte ceiling. Session/checkpoint enumeration,
relation traversal and transcript streaming do not depend on Tantivy.

The versioned native-capture normalizer retains the complete sanitized capture
envelope as one observation. Processing ordinals order these observations;
native event cursors and provider frame sequences remain exact evidence, never
replacement identities. Complete groups project through existing controller
session/turn/message/tool aliases. Only a bounded deferred text prefix may share
an ordinal with its triggering frame. Malformed bindings, policy/progress
mismatches and unsupported group shapes reject before publication. Existing
controller-v2 observations and all canonical object formats are unchanged.
